*Why have a reverse proxy?*

---

# Why have a reverse proxy?

* Load balancing

* HTTP caching

* Security:

    * port protection in a centralized manner

    * TLS encryption deployed only once (between the reverse proxy and the client rather than than the proxy and every single server)

# Run Nginx in a Docker container

Run Docker (map port 80 internal to port 8080 external):

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 nginx
```

*Try accessing it in your browser.*

Nginx is now serving its default page. We can see that it is served by Nginx by looking at the `Server` response header in the browser's developer tools.

Try stopping the container. 

*What happens when you refresh the page?*

<details> 
  <summary>Answer</summary>
   Depends! Sometimes the browser has a tendency to cache the page. Try a hard refresh if you still see something outdated content or a page even after Nginx was stopped.

# The Nginx configuration file

Nginx defines things in a nginx.conf file. See what it contains here:

```
$ docker run --rm nginx cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Alternatively, create a shell for the container and check it out:

```
$ docker run --rm -it nginx sh
```

*Can you figure out where to find the file based on this slide?*

# Nginx configuration

Syntax: 

* Directives have keys and values and are separated by semicolons.

* Contexts are blocks of directives.

*Can you point out examples of both in the `nginx.conf` file?*

# Hands-on: Serving static content

Create a folder anywhere. I will create mine in the semester repository and name it `06._Nginx`.

Create a folder inside of it called `mywebsite` put a `index.html` file in it.

In the html file add a greeting message so that we can see something when we access the page.

---

# Serving static content - Configure Nginx

Create a `nginx.conf` and add the following to it:

```nginx
events {}

http {
    server {
        listen  8080;
        root    /usr/share/nginx/html;
    }
}
```

Nginx will automatically look for an `index.html` file in the root folder.


---

# Running the example with mywebsite

Let's start the container. Run this where the conf file and the `mywebsite` folder is:

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 \
	-v $(pwd)/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro \
	-v $(pwd)/mywebsite:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro \
	nginx
```

The format is `host_path:container_path:mode`. The `ro` mode means read-only and is just a security feature.

**Line 2**: We're mounting the local config file to the config of the image.

**Line 3**: We're mounting the local static files to the `/usr/share/nginx/html` as defined by the config file.

If it doesn't work with `$(pwd)`, replace it with the absolute path to the folder.

---

# Changing the static content

It should work now after the previous slide!

Now, make a change to the HTML. 

*What will happen if we refresh the browser Nginx?*

While it works with changing the HTML in the host machine, if we make changes to the `nginx.conf` file, we have to restart Nginx.

Since we are working with containers we can do this by simply stopping and starting the container.

---

# Mime types

Let's add a `styles.css` file to the `mywebsite` folder.

```css
body {
    background-color: lightblue;
}
```

Add a link to the `styles.css` file in the `index.html` file.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

*Does it work? Why or why not? Where can we check? What is wrong?*

---

# Mime types - Debugging

The Nginx server is correctly serving the CSS file.

We can check in the browser's developer tools in the Network tab.

The response header `Content-Type` is set to `text/plain`.

It should be `text/css`.

---

# Mime types - Fixing it

Add a types context to the http context:

```nginx
events {}

http {
    types {
        text/css            css;
        text/html           html;
        text/javascript     js;
    }

    ...
}

... 
```

What it does is that it maps the `Content-Type` to the file extension.

Refresh in the browser. 

It works! But it's not optimal. *Why not?* 

---

# Mime types

But our solution is not ideal. We would have to manually add every mime type.

Nginx has a built-in list of mime types in the file `mime.types`.

Instead of pasting the types context in the `nginx.conf` file, we can include the `mime.types` file.

```nginx
http {
    include     mime.types;

    ...
}
```

*Rerun Nginx and test it out.*

---

# Defining a location blocks

Create a folder in `mywebsite` called `myfavoritethings` and create an `index.html` in it that displays some of your favorite things.

Add a location block to the server block in the `nginx.conf` file:

```nginx
...
http {
    ...

	server {
		listen 8080;
		root /usr/share/nginx/html;

		location /myfavoritethings {
			root /usr/share/nginx/html;
		}
	}
}
```

Because the location is `/myfavoritethings`, it will find the `index.html` in the `myfavoritethings` folder.

*Rerun Nginx and test it out.*

---

# Location blocks

Reuse the `myfavoritethings` html, but serve it on a different path:

```nginx
http {

    ...

    server {
        ...

        location /generallynicethings {
            alias /usr/share/nginx/html/myfavoritethings;
        }
    }
}
```

So while defining a `root` will append the location to the root, 

`alias` will replace the location with the alias.

---

# Regular expressions in paths

Regular expressions can be defined following the `~*` operator.

```nginx
location ~* /count/[0-9] {
    try_files /count/count.html /index.html =404;
}
```

*What do you think the above location block does?*

We haven't talked about `try_files` but it tries the files in order and `=404` is how we can return an error if everything else fails.

# Running Nginx on a server without Docker - I

This slide is might become useful if you ever have to run a bare Nginx server.

## Starting Nginx
 
Right now we are running Nginx automatically as we start the container. But if has been installed on a server, we could do the following to start it:

```bash
$ nginx
```

## Reloading

Every time we make changes to the config we have to reload Nginx:

```bash
$ nginx -s reload
```

---

# Running Nginx on a server without Docker - II

## Stopping Nginx

Graceful stop:

```bash
$ nginx -s quit
```

Force stop:

```bash
$ nginx -s stop
```

# Whoknows variations - Continuous Deployment

Let's see on how Nginx has been made to work:

https://github.com/who-knows-inc/whoknows_variations/tree/continuous_deployment

There are two approaches to how to configure Nginx as discussed here:

https://github.com/who-knows-inc/whoknows_variations/blob/continuous_deployment/tutorials/01._Ways_to_Achieve_Continuous_Deployment.md#deploying-nginx

---

# [The `nginx.conf` file](https://github.com/who-knows-inc/whoknows_variations/blob/continuous_deployment/src/network/nginx.conf)

```nginx
events { }

http {
    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://whoknows_flask:8080;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
}
```

**Host**: Keeps the original request’s host header.

**X-Real-IP**: Passes the client’s real IP address.

**X-Forwarded-For**: Tracks the client’s IP across proxies.

**X-Forwarded-Proto**: Keeps the original request’s protocol (http or https).
