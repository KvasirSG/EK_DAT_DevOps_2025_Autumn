# People are not machines

It may sound like DevOps is so focused on value stream and the immediate end-result that it is willing to sacrifice the well-being of the team. That would be a a misuse of the overall philosophy behind DevOps.

DevOps at its core simply tries to identify friction and annoyances in order to alleviate the pain points.

DevOps should not be used as a tool against the workers.

It is unsustainable to constantly push for productivity.

# The PPT framework

DevOps literature thoroughly consider the human aspect of the process and it has inspired multiple frameworks.

Example: **PPT framework**

3 keys to an organization's success:

1. People

2. Process

3. Technology

Never sacrifice one for the other.

# SPACE

Rather than focusing on shallow metrics such as number of commits (looking at you DevOps course), the SPACE framework is a more holistic approach to measuring productivity: 

* **S**atisfaction and well-being
* **P**erformance
* **A**ctivity
* **C**ommunication and Collaboration
* **E**fficiency and flow.

# Example of how to create a positive DevOps culture: Swarming problems together

Andon Cord is a concept from the Toyota Production System. 

[Wikipedia: Andon Manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andon_%28manufacturing%29)

It appears in various DevOps literature. 

https://devops.com/youre-not-devops-cant-pull-cord/

The DevOps Handbook brings a case of how Excella implemented the Andon cord.

# Definition: Cycle time

*Does this sound familiar?*

> "Excella noticed during a team retrospective that their cycle times were beginning to rise. They had what Joshua Cohen described as a case of the “almost dones.” He noted, “During standup, our developers would give an update on the feature they were working on the previous day. They would say, ‘Hey, I made a lot of progress. I’m almost done.’ And the next morning they would say, ‘Hey, I ran into some issues but I worked through them. I just have a few more tests to run. I’m almost done.’”"

\- Ayers and Cohen, “Andon Cords in Development Teams.”

> "To measure their Andon cord experiment, the team decided to focus on reduction in cycle time as the key metric for success, as well as increasing the team’s collaboration and getting rid of the “almost dones” by talking about issues when they arose."

# How they implemented it

> "Instead of a literal string or cord to pull, the team created a bot in Slack as a metaphorical Andon cord. When someone typed in andon, the bot would @here the team, notifying everyone in Slack. But they didn’t want to end it there. They also created an “if/this/then/that” integration in Slack that would turn on a rotating red light, string lights, and even a dancing “tube” man in the office."

# Free discussion

DevOps shouldn't be a cult. 

First you had to understand it better and now is your chance to think critically about DevOps.

*What do you think?*
