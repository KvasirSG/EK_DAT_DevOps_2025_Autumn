<!-- todo -->

This is what I have found by using the website as a normal user would. I have not reviewed the security feature for old accounts.

**WeKnow**: The "website" is just a text string. :(

**MixedLaptops**: Inherits the styling problems of the legacy project.

**5%_uptime_gang**: Looks good. "Error loading weather data: Failed to fetch weather"

**DVK-DevOps**: Inherits the styling problems of the legacy project. Shows log out on the main page when not logged in.

# Let's still review your projects!

**Martin-s-angels**: Got an error when trying to access the website.

**devkopa**: Doesn't load.

**CodeLab-DevOps**: Missing logo, login etc. on the page.

**GitDenGas123456**: Nginx welcome page.
