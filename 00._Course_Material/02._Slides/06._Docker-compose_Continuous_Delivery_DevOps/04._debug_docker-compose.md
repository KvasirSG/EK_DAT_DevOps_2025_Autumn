# Let's set up a Node.js project

1. Create a folder called `05._Debug_Docker`.

2. Inside of it create a folder called `app`.

3. In the `app` folder run the following commands:

```bash
$ npm init -y
$ npm install express
```

In the top-level of package.json change to `type: module`.

---

# Let's create a simple Express server

Inside of `app` create a file called `app.js` which should contain the following:

```javascript
import express from 'express';
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send({ data: 'Hello World!'});
});

app.listen(80, () => {
    console.log('App running on port 80');
});
```

---

# Create the faulty `Dockerfile`

Create a folder called `app` and add to the `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:14

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

---

# Create the faulty `docker-compose.yml`

Outside of the `app` directory create a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: ./app
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    networks:
      - app_net

  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: root
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass123
    networks:
      - db_net

networks:
  app_net:
    driver: bridge
  db_net:
    driver: bridge
```

---

# Let's run it

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build
```

---

# Did it start?

Is the process running? How do we check?

<details> 
  <summary>Answer</summary>
    
    <!-- ```bash -->
    $ docker-compose ps -a
    <!-- ``` -->
</details>

How do we check the logs?

<details> 
  <summary>Answer</summary>

    <!-- ```bash -->
    $ docker-compose logs <container_name>
    <!-- ``` -->
</details>

# You might've noticed it when running `docker-compose up --build`

But the it doesn't run because it expect to find a start script in `package.json`.

Add it:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node app.js"
}
```

Run `docker-compose up --build` again and check if it's running.

```bash
$ docker-compose ps
```

---

# Check the logs

You should be able to guess the `container_name` based on how it named the db service:

```bash
$ docker logs <container_name>
```

There doesn't seem to be any startup errors. It's running as it should on port `80`.

But try to access it from `localhost:80`. *Does it work?*

---

# Verify what ports have been opened in the container

See which ports have been opened in the container:

```bash
$ docker ps --format "{{.Names}}: {{.Ports}}"
```

`ss` is a utility to investigate sockets. It's an alternative to `netstat`. Use it to checkout the app:

```bash
$ docker exec -it <container_name> ss -tuln
```

---

# Let's see if the environment variables work 

In `app.js`, change the route to the following:

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send({ data: `Hello from the ${process.env.NODE_ENV} environment` });
});
```

Where has the `NODE_ENV` environment variable been set? What do we expect it to be?

Rerun `docker-compose up --build` and check in the browser if it works. 

---

# It doesn't work

In the browser it says:

```json
{
  "data": "Hello from the undefined environment"
}
```

Let's see if the environment variable is set in the container.

```bash
$ docker exec <container_name> env | grep NODE_ENV
```

---

# The way we defined the environment variable is incorrect

In the `docker-compose-yml` file, we can use either:

```yaml
  environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
```

or

```yaml
  environment:
      - NODE_ENV: production
```

---

# Let's test out the database

Install the PostgreSQL driver (`pg`):

```bash
$ npm install pg
```

Add this to the `app.js`:

```javascript
import pkg from 'pg';
const { Pool } = pkg;

const pool = new Pool({
  user: process.env.POSTGRES_USER,
  host: 'db',
  database: 'postgres',
  password: process.env.POSTGRES_PASSWORD,
  port: 5432,
});

pool.query('SELECT NOW()', (err, res) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    console.log(res.rows[0]);
  }
});
```

---

# First: Let's debug the container

Verify the database container is running:

  ```bash
  $ docker-compose ps
  ```

Check logs for database startup issues:

  ```bash
  $ docker logs <db_container_name>
  ```

---

# Next: Let's debug the connection

Pre-debug step: Install `ping` in the app container:

  ```bash
  $ docker exec -it <app_container_name> apt-get update
  $ docker exec -it <app_container_name> apt-get install -y iputils-ping
  ```

Test connection between containers (using Dockerâ€™s built-in networking):

  ```bash
  $ docker exec -it <app_container_name> ping db
  ```

We are **not** able to ping it.

Try connecting manually to the db container:

  ```bash
  $ docker exec -it <db_container_name> psql -h db -U root -d postgres
  ```

But we *are* able to access the database.

---

# See which networks the containers are connected to

List all networks:

```bash
$ docker network ls
```

Check which networks the containers are connected to:

```bash
$ docker inspect <app_container_name> --format='{{json .NetworkSettings.Networks}}' | jq '.[].NetworkID'
$ docker inspect <db_container_name> --format='{{json .NetworkSettings.Networks}}' | jq '.[].NetworkID'
```

`.[].NetworkID'` is a `jq` filter to only display the network id. You can also try without it.

The networks have different ids. They are not connected to the same network.

---

# Simplify the `docker-compose.yml` and let them join the same network

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production

  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: root
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass123
```

---

# Problems with the environment variables again

To see the environment variables in the container:

```bash
$ docker exec <app_container_name> env
```

*What is the problem? How do we fix it?*


---

# The problem is the environment variables are not set

The db credentials have not been defined as environment variables on the app container. 

There are better solutions that will not require us to push the environment variables but for now let's add them to the docker-compose file:

```yaml
environment:
    POSTGRES_USER: root
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass123
```

Try it out. It should work now.
