# Implement tests

Implement various types of tests as part of your development process. 

**Type**: Group work

**Motivation**: Make your application more robust and avoid fatal errors in the rest of the course.

# Where to implement 

Notice that it says to implement tasks as part of your development process; not just CI/CD.

Tests can run locally before pushing to the repository.

Tests can also run after a new version of the application has been deployed.

# What to implement

It is optional to implement unit tests. It would be nice to implement a few just to see how it works in your chosen language. 

It is required to implement integration tests. This could be mock  tests. End-to-end tests are a subset of integration tests. For inspiration regarding how to make it work with Playwright check out https://github.com/who-knows-inc/whoknows_variations/tree/end-to-end_testing

Feel free to implement other types of tests as well.

You must consider all types of test and remember why you decided that they were not relevant to the project.

# How much to implement

For the sake of the course it is better to setup a variety of tests to show that you can rather than performing one type of tests exhaustively.
